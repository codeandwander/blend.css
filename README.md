## Blend.css

Blend is a lightweight css plugin that makes it super simple to blend images, colors and text. I got fed up of creating blending classes so I've smashed them into one easy file to implement. Includes colours from Google's Material Design palette to easily create beautiful heros. You can use it with any css framework.


## Usage


```html
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="blend.min.css">
</head>
```
